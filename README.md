# Website The 1975

Website developed through studies of the<a href= "https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-html-e-css-v516853"> HTML and CSS</a> course offered by <a href="https://www.alura.com.br/">Alura</a>. I used as a basis the current design of the album (<a href="https://the1975.com/">BFIAFL 2022</a>) of the band and texts from the <a href="https://genius.com/artists/The-1975">Genius</a>. All rights reserved for them. All intention was to learn to develop the pages in my way of interpretation adapting with the studies of the course.

### Improvements:
* Add horizontal dropdown menu in Albums and Lyrics.
* In Lyrics, add three columns with the titles of the songs and when clicked, on the same page, show the complete lyrics of the song without forwarding to another page.
* Add internal search menu.
* Change font color in Tour.
* Explore different ways of displaying the album and tracklist.
* In the future change the layout according to each album.

✨That's all for now✨
